  $description = "The Pack Market is a site for purchasing random packs of virtual cards from various sports games, including FIFA
		and MADDEN.  Instead of receiving those players, however, the value of the players can be redeemed into your account
		for purchasing whoever you want later off of the market.
	</p>
	<p>
		By giving a chance to win incredibly valuable packs for a small
		amount of money, this method combines the rush of opening a pack and seeing who you got with the freedom to choose players,
		and possibly win big.";
