  $description = "The Pack Market is a site for purchasing random packs of virtual cards from various sports games, including FIFA and MADDEN.  Instead of receiving those players, however, the value of the players can be redeemed into your account
		for purchasing whoever you want later off of the market, combining the thrill of opening random packs with the versatility of raw coins.";
