		Over the summer, I wanted to look at some statistics for one of the GroupMe's that I was in. I looked around, and found GroupMe had an open REST API. I wrote a quick script to scrape all the data using my account, and I compiled it into some basic information: who had the most comments, who had the most likes, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		I realized that I could turn this into a larger web application that anyone could use.  Thus, GroupMe Analysis was born, a quick and easy (and private) way to analyze statistics of a GroupMe without giving anyone long lasting access to your GroupMe account.
