	<p>
		After freshman year, all students at Dartmouth are assigned a housing number.  This number determines
		your priority in getting the room you want.  Prior to Dartmouth Room Search being launched, to find 
		the perfect room you would have to comb through numerous poorly formatted floor plans, with unclear room dimensions
		and unlabeled gender restrictions.
	</p>
	<p>
		This site amalgamates all the data including size, bathrooms, gender, number 
		of people, and rooms into one easy convenient place.  It then allows you to filter by your preferences, 
		and sort the results by square feet per person, number of people, and more through an easy to use sentence-based search
		method.
