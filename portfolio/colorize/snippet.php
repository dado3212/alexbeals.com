		A while ago I was designing a website, and wanted a good color blue. However, I'm incredibly indecisive when it comes to choosing color palettes. I envisioned some site that would allow me to type in 'blue', and it would give me the ideal blue color. This idea was fleshed out into Colorize. It takes in a search criteria, and then averages the colors returned in the first page of Google Image results to return a single hex color.
